SOMA Shade Control
======================

This project was created to control the SOMA smart shades using BLE. 

It refers heavily to [SOMA-Smart-Shades-HTTP-API](https://github.com/paolotremadio/SOMA-Smart-Shades-HTTP-API),
but will be written as a node library using noble instead of invoking
the GATT Tool directly.
